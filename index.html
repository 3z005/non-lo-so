            <p>Jellyfish is also known as sea jellies. 
            They are free-swimming marine animals with umbrella-shaped bells and  trailing tentacles, although a few are anchored to the seabed by stalks rather than being mobile.
            Jellyfish are found all over the world, from surface waters to the deep sea. 
            Scyphozoans, the "true jellyfish", are exclusively marine, but some hydrozoans with a similar appearance live in freshwater. Large, often colorful, jellyfish are common in coastal zones worldwide. 
            The medusae of most species are fast-growing, and mature within a few months then die soon after breeding, but the polyp stage, attached to the seabed, may be much more long-lived. 
            Jellyfish have been in existence for at least 500 million years, and possibly 700 million years or more, making them the oldest multi-organ animal group.</p>

                    They are also used in cell and molecular biology research, 
                    especially the green fluorescent protein used by some species for bioluminescence.
